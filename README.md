learning_python
===============

Repo for files written during my "learning Python" process... and getting used to git and github

If anyone else reads any of these, and finds errors in my logic... or anything that needs improvement. Please say so. I'm open to feedback.

Call this my "open source learning" process, if you will. Not that I'm learning about OSS, specifically... but just leaving the whole discussion wide open, and trying to get good direction. Does that makes sense?
